# Winter Framework

My tryout to create simplified version of Spring Framework core which supports following:

* Classpath scanning for components
* Multi-staged constructor for components
* 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The project has no dependencies, it uses only pure java, you don't need to preinstall anything except java.

``` bash 
âœ— java -version
openjdk version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13, mixed mode)
```

### Installing

Clone the project and open in your favourite IDE.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running

Just run [Main.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/Main.java) to test framework functionality.
Several services created fot testing purposes:

* [ServiceBean.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/test/ServiceBean.java)
which is annotated with `@Component` thus managed by container
and implements [BeanNameAware.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/winterframework/beans/factory/BeanNameAware.java) callback. 
Also he demonstrates the setter-based injection (see TODO)
* [AnotherServiceBean.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/test/AnotherServiceBean.java)
which is annotated with `@Component` thus managed by container and implements two callbacks - [InitializingBean.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/winterframework/beans/factory/InitializingBean.java)
and [ApplicationEventListener.java](https://github.com/vlsidlyarevich/winter-framework/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/winterframework/context/ApplicationEventListener.java).
Also he has property-based injection, and `@PostConstruct` lifecycle callback.
