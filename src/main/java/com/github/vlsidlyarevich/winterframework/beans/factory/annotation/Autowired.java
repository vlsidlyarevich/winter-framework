/**
 * Marks a constructor, field, setter method or config method as to be autowired by
 * Spring's dependency injection facilities.
 *
 * <p>Only one constructor (at max) of any given bean class may declare this annotation
 * with the 'required' parameter set to {@code true}, indicating <i>the</i> constructor
 * to autowire when used as a Spring bean. If multiple <i>non-required</i> constructors
 * declare the annotation, they will be considered as candidates for autowiring.
 * The constructor with the greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by
 * matching beans in the Spring container will be chosen. If none of the candidates
 * can be satisfied, then a primary/default constructor (if present) will be used.
 * If a class only declares a single constructor to begin with, it will always be used,
 * even if not annotated. An annotated constructor does not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods
 * are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public.
